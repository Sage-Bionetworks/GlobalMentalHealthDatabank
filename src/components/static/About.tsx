          The COVID Recovery Corps is a citizen-powered research study to learn
          more about COVID-19 and make progress in the global fight. The study
          aims to enable recovered individuals to help scientists answer key
          questions yet to be fully resolved -- from how the body fights the
          disease and how it may or may not be similar to other treatable
          diseases, to whether infection affords any level of immunity. Starting
          in the New York metropolitan area - the epicenter of the pandemic in
          the United States - participants will be the cornerstone of a powerful
          dataset that may lead to scientific breakthroughs and save lives.

        <p>Step 1: Eligibility and consent</p>
        <p>
          Once you confirm your eligibility, we will ask you to review and sign
          the informed consent. The consent will explain what will happen in the
          study, as well as risks and benefits. You can also choose whether or
          not to give researchers permission to access your medical records and
          use this information for the study.

        <p>Step 3: Share your samples..</p>
        <p>
          In the first phase of the study, we will ask participants who have
          completed the survey to visit clinical sites in New York City to
          donate a blood sample for research. In the next phase of the study, we
          hope to send saliva and/or finger stick sample collection kits to
          participantsâ€™ homes to detect antibodies to COVID-19, suggesting that
          they were infected with COVID-19 in the past.

        <p>Step 4: Learn with us along the way.</p>
        <p>
          Your ongoing participation will create a powerful dataset that may
          lead to a scientific breakthrough in COVID-19. We will return results
          of the antibody test to you and share information about what those
          results mean as we learn together. We plan to share summaries of what
          we find out from the study as we learn

          You choose how your data is used and shared.
        </p>
        <p>
          By default, your data will be shared only with researchers in the
          study. You can decide if you want to share your data with other
          qualified researchers outside of the study. Optional HIPAA
          authorization Access to the study database will be controlled. This
          means that other researchers may request to use de-identified study
          data (no names or other identifying information shared) for their
          research projects, but those researchers must first be approved by the
          COVID Recovery Corps study team.
